# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this project was to compare several machine learning algorithms to predict credit risk.
* Deliverable 1 - We explored oversampling the data using RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms and undersampled the data using ClusterCentroids algorithm.
* Deliverable 2 - We explored a combinatorial approach of over and undersampling using the SMOTEEN algorithm.
* Deliverable 3 - We explored 2 new machine learning models, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, that reduce bias.

## Results
* RandomOverSampler


* SMOTE

* Cluster Centroids

* SMOTEEN

* BalancedRandomForestClassifier

* EasyEnsembleClassifier
